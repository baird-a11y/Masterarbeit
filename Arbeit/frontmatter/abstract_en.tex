This master's thesis investigates the generalization capability of UNet architectures for predicting flow fields in multi-crystal sedimentation systems. While traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods are computationally intensive for complex multi-particle systems, machine learning approaches offer the potential for significant acceleration.

This exploratory study systematically evaluates whether UNet networks trained on single-crystal configurations can successfully generalize to systems with 2-15 crystals. Using LaMEM simulations as ground truth, controlled experiments with increasing complexity are conducted. The results demonstrate [placeholder for actual findings], thereby characterizing both the possibilities and fundamental limitations of UNet generalization in multi-particle flow systems.

This work contributes methodologically to physics-informed machine learning research and provides practical insights for geoscientific modeling applications.
